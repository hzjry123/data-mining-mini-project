"0","# Use k-means and hierarchical clustering to group stocks. Specifically, you will generate 8 MDS maps for the stocks and color the stocks based on different clustering methods (k-means, h-clustering with single-link, h-clustering with complete-link, h-clustering with average-link) and different number of clusters (k = 3, k = 6). For each hierarchical clustering method, generate a dendrogram."
