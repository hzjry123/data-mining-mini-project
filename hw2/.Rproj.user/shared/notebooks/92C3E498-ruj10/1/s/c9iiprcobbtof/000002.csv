"0","#Implement a 10-fold cross-validation scheme by splitting the data into training and testing sets. Use the training set to train a logistic regression model to predict the response variable. Examine the performance of different models by varing the number of predictors. Report the performance of the models on testing set using proper measures (accuracy, precision, recall, F1) and plots (ROC, lift)."
